#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/fast-calculator/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/fast-calculator/db/*.sqlite3
/fast-calculator/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/fast-calculator/log/*
/fast-calculator/tmp/*
!/fast-calculator/log/.keep
!/fast-calculator/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/fast-calculator/tmp/pids/*
!/fast-calculator/tmp/pids/
!/fast-calculator/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/fast-calculator/storage/*
!/fast-calculator/storage/.keep

/fast-calculator/public/assets
/fast-calculator.byebug_history
